By engaging in the quiz and actively participating in the learning process, the user aims to expand their knowledge of German words and their meanings. The game provides an interactive and engaging platform where users can test their understanding of vocabulary in a fun and challenging way.

### Future Goals

To further enhance user engagement and cater to a broader audience, additional questions can be incorporated into the quiz, including varying levels of difficulty. Here are a few examples:

Easy level:

a) Guten Tag
b) Auf Wiedersehen
c) Danke

Medium level:
What is the German word for "car"?
a) Fahrrad
b) Auto
c) Haus

To add an extra layer of challenge and time constraint, a timer can be displayed for each question, prompting users to answer within a limited amount of time. For instance, users may have 30 seconds or 1 minute to select their answer before the timer runs out.

The inclusion of additional questions and the implementation of a timer can increase user engagement, create a sense of urgency, and add an element of excitement to the quiz, motivating users to complete it while sharpening their vocabulary skills within a given timeframe.
